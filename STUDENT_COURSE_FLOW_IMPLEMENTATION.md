# Student Course Flow Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
This implementation provides a complete student-side flow for course discovery, preview, enrollment, and learning. Students can browse courses, view detailed previews, enroll through a checkout process, and access the course player with dynamic backend data.

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

  - Real-time search and filtering
  - Responsive course cards with ratings, pricing, and stats
  - Click functionality to navigate to course preview

### 2. Course Preview (`/student/courses/:courseId`)

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration
All components fetch data from the backend using:
```javascript
const response = await axios.get(`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/courses/approved`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

### Data Transformation
Course data is transformed to match UI expectations:
```javascript
const transformedCourse = {
  id: course._id,
  title: course.title,
  instructor: course.educator?.name,
  curriculum: course.curriculum?.map((section, index) => ({
    id: index + 1,
    title: section.title,
    lessons: section.lessons?.map((lesson, lessonIndex) => ({
      id: (index * 100) + lessonIndex + 1,
      title: lesson.title,
      videoUrl: lesson.videoUrl || lesson.videoFile,
      transcript: lesson.summary ? [...] : [],
      notes: lesson.summary ? `${lesson.summary}\n\n${lesson.questions?.join('\n')}` : ''
    }))
  }))
};
```

### Navigation Flow
1. **CourseCard click** → `/student/courses/:courseId` (Preview)
2. **Enroll Now** → `/student/checkout/:courseId` (Payment)
3. **Payment success** → `/student/course-player/:courseId` (Learning)
